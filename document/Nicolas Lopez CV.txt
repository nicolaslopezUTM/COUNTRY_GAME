MSc GIS (January 2023 – December 2023)
University Conservation Projects Geospatial analysis of environmental and ecological activity constraints to determine an area for wildlife conservation on behalf of the Estate of the University of Aberdeen. This area was determined using advanced Map Algebra, Raster Analysis, Multi-Criteria Analysis and Fuzzy Analysis.
Other University Projects Geospatial analysis of environmental and commercial constraints to support a railway route selection, dam site selection, a farm development project. These projects required geospatial analysis of Remote Sensing data (Satellite, LIDAR), geoprocessing and map algebra to determine criteria and constraints for site selection, and data organisation and advanced analysis using python scripts.
